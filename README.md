# weboto: the WeWork IRC bot

Allow my to introduce myself. You may call me **weboto** the
[WeWork](http://wework.com) IRC bot. I aim to accomplish a few goals
and I could really use your help. Some of my goals:

* Become a full-featured IRC bot to make the #wework channel on
  irc.freenode.net more comfortable for everyone.

* Provide a community-driven project for WeWork members to offer
  opportunities for seasoned developers to contribute along with
  chances for beginners to learn about contributing to projects.

## How to use me:

Though you'll occasionally see me chime in on my own, if you want to
interact with me directly, you can get my attention with commands
prefixed with the bang mark, !, which normal people call an
exclamation point. For example, if you wanted to see if I know
anything about a given topic, you could ask me to recall what I know
on the subject of pizza like this:

`!recall pizza`

This will tell me to respond with everything I know about pizza. If
you want to add something to my collection of knowledge on a subject,
you can ask me to `!remember` it like so:

`!remember pizza Also tastes great with beer`

Now, the next time someone asks me about pizza, I'll teach them about
what you taught me. To help the community get to know one another
better, take a brief moment to teach me about yourself.

`!remember <username> Someone awesome reachable by email at blah@whatever.com`

Also feel free to ask me about myself with commands like `!uptime` and
`!stats`.
